\section{Preliminaries} \label{Prelim}
For computational ease and notational simplicity, throughout this
paper we denote by $\phi\left(.|\mu,\sigma^2\right)$ the
probabi-lity density function (pdf) of the normal distribution with
mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. $\phi(.)$ and $\Phi(.)$
respectively the pdf and the cumulative distribution function (cdf)
of the standard normal distribution.  We start by defining the SMN
distributions and its hierarchical formulation and then introduce
some further properties.
The symmetrical class of SMN distributions includes the Pearson type
VII, the Student-t, the slash and the contaminated normal
distribution. Some of these distributions are described
subsequently. For each element of this class, we also compute the
quantities $\textrm{\em E}_{\phi}\left(r,h\right)$ and $\textrm{\em
E}_{\Phi}\left(r,h\right)$, which are useful in the implementation
of the ECME algorithm.
